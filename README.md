### About Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo. It is a time management technique that helps you stay focused and productive. 
           
**Hereâ€™s how it works:**     
- Work for 25 minutes: Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on a task without interruptions.     
- Take a short break: When the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. Use this time to relax or do something different from work.     
- Repeat: After the break, start another 25-minute work session.    
- Take a longer break: After completing four 25-minute sessions (called "Pomodoros"), take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes.      
              
The idea is that short, focused work periods followed by regular breaks can improve concentration and prevent burnout.
